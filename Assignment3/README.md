## Description

This assignment addresses the Open Shop scheduling problem O3|r_j|C_max, implementing algorithms and verification scripts to solve and validate scheduling scenarios. The problem involves scheduling jobs on 3 machines where each job consists of 3 operations (one per machine), with release times for each job. The goal is to minimize the makespan (C_max) by determining the optimal execution order of operations while respecting constraints that operations of the same job cannot run simultaneously and each machine can process only one operation at a time.
