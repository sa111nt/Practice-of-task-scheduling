Description
This assignment addresses task scheduling on parallel heterogeneous machines, implementing algorithms and verification scripts to solve and validate scheduling scenarios. The goal is to optimize task allocation across multiple machines and determine the best execution order to maximize total early work based on given constraints and machine speed characteristics.
